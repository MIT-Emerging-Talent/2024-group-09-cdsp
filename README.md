One important global health indicator is child mortality, which is the death rate of children under five. Data on child mortality must be analyzed to comprehend societal well-being and pinpoint areas in need of focused actions. Our goal in this data science project is to investigate and evaluate child mortality statistics to produce significant findings that can guide public health initiatives and policy. 
 Child mortality is a complex issue influenced by various socio-economic, cultural, and healthcare factors. Through this data science project, we aim to contribute valuable insights that can guide policymakers, healthcare professionals, and organizations in their efforts to reduce child mortality and improve the overall well-being of children globally.
