### Source Data 
<!-- your comment -->
The DHS program's Demographic and Health Survey is our main source of data for this research. Data on child mortality rates for various nations, regions, and periods can be found in this dataset. The variables could be things like maternal education, healthcare facilities, socioeconomic level, and other pertinent indicators. 


## Methodology
<!-- your comment -->
The project employs a machine learning approach, specifically linear regression, to model the relationship between various features and child mortality rates. The methodology involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
1.	Data Extraction and cleaning:

•	The initial step involved extracting relevant data from the original dataset. This extraction was performed manually to curate a subset of data that aligns with the project's objectives.

2.	Handling Data Consistency:

•	Emphasis was placed on ensuring data consistency. This included checking for any discrepancies or anomalies within the dataset. Any inconsistencies were addressed to maintain the integrity of the data.

3.	Categorical Variable Transformation:

  •	For categorical variables,a transformation process was implemented to convert them into a suitable format for machine learning models. This step is crucial as many machine learning algorithms require numerical input. Techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding were applied to represent categorical variables in a format that models could interpret effectively.

4.	Model Training:
   - Train three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
   - Use historical data to teach each model the relationship between features and child mortality rates.
5.   Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate each model's performance using statistical metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Compare the models' predictive accuracy and their ability to capture underlying patterns in the data.
6. Model Selection:
   - Select the model with the best performance based on evaluation metrics.
   - Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models will be compared to determine the most effective for predicting child mortality rates.

   Note: After careful evaluation, the Linear Regression model demonstrated superior performance in predicting child mortality rates compared to Random Forest and Decision Tree models. This decision is based on comprehensive analysis using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
7. Interactive Interface:
   - Develop an interactive user interface using Streamlit to allow users to input specific years and receive predictions based on the chosen machine learning model.
8.  Results Presentation:
   - Present the results of the selected machine learning model's predictions.
   - Visualize the model's accuracy and provide insights into the factors influencing child mortality rates.

### Non Technical Explanation
<!---your comment--->
In simpler terms, this project aims to understand and predict child mortality rates globally. We use historical data and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and relationships between various factors and child mortality. The results will help policymakers make informed decisions to improve child health.
### Techniacal Explanation

The technical approach involves preprocessing datasets, training a linear regression model to understand the correlation between features and child mortality rates. The model is evaluated using statistical metrics, and the predictive capabilities are assessed. The project utilizes Python, machine learning libraries, and Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface.

### Communication Summary
Key Insights:

African Countries and High Mortality Rates:

 The analysis revealed that a significant number of African countries consistently exhibit some of the highest child mortality rates globally. Despite noticeable reductions in child mortality over the past years, these African nations continue to face challenges in achieving substantial improvements. 

Persistent Challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa: 

Sub-Saharan African countries, in particular, have been disproportionately affected. Factors such as prolonged periods of war, political instability, and insufficient governmental commitment to healthcare infrastructure have contributed to the ongoing struggle to address child mortality effectively.

Machine Learning Model Selection: 

The project employed various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. After comprehensive evaluation using statistical metrics, the Linear Regression model emerged as the most effective in predicting child mortality rates.
Recommendations:
Targeted Interventions for African Nations: Given the persistent challenges in African countries, there is a crucial need for targeted interventions. These may include increased investments in healthcare infrastructure, addressing political instability, and fostering international collaborations to support healthcare initiatives.
Continued Monitoring and Evaluation: 

Continuous monitoring and evaluation of child mortality rates are essential to track the impact of interventions. This will help adapt strategies based on evolving circumstances and ensure sustained progress.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Modeling Tomorrow project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of child mortality rates globally. While progress has been made and sure will be made too, addressing the unique challenges faced by African nations, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, remains paramount. The use of machine learning models enhances our predictive capabilities, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.
