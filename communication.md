# Communication

1. Regularly update GitHub (at least once per week) and deliver high-quality work.
2. Be transparent, convey expectations clearly, actively listen, and seek to understand others' perspectives.
3. Be honest, admit mistakes, take responsibility, and uphold ethical standards.
4. Display empathy while discouraging laziness and disorganization.
5. Encourage open communication, be receptive to opinions and ideas.
6. Be supportive and uplifting consistently.
7. If you fail, then count up to 3 and go rebuild trust through actions.
8. Each feedback is valuable, even if negative, and emphasizes the importance of keeping communication straightforward, playing the long game.
9. For communication we use Slack, Zoom, Google Docs.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
